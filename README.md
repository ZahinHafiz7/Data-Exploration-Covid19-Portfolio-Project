# Data-Exploration-Covid19-PortfolioProject
This is my simple portfolio project of data exploration of Covid-19 using SQL
This SQL project explores COVID-19 data from two tables: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. It includes various queries to analyze aspects such as total cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and percentages based on population and location.

The project covers tasks like:

Extracting data for COVID deaths and vaccinations.
Calculating death percentages and infection rates for specific locations like Malaysia.
Analyzing the highest infection and death rates by country and continent.
Summarizing global COVID-19 statistics like total cases, deaths, and vaccination percentages.
Creating temporary tables and views for data visualization and further analysis.
Overall, the project provides insights into the impact of COVID-19 in different regions and highlights vaccination progress in combating the pandemic.
